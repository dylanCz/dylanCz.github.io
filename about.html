                Hello! My name is Dylan Clark and I'm currently a Senior DevOps
                Engineer from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. I work at Smarter Grid Solutions with
                an incredible team of people to help customers manage their DER
                (distributed energy resources). I'm part of the DevOps team,
                where I focus on automating and optimizing our infrastructure
                and deployments.

                Before joining the DevOps team, I worked as a Software Engineer
                at Smarter Grid Solutions. I was involved in the development of
                Java Springboot micro-services, as we transitioned our flagship
                product from a monolithic architecture to a microservices
                architecture.

                When I'm not focusing on my career, there's a good chance I'm
                doing something related to competitive gaming. I've been playing
                Super Smash Brothers Melee competitively for over 10 years now
                and have travelled all over the world just to compete. I'm also
                a competitive Rubik's Cuber, you can see my competition PB's
